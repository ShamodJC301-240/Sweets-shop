Butter & Bonbons bakery

This is my first mock website build. Mainly playing around with the idea of a family owned bakery; A previous dream of mine. The plan going into this was to just relearn what code can do. So glad I have google because it was my #1 consultant, and even with that I was on the struggle bus. I'm going to periodically adjust and tweak this code, but I feel like I am going to study it and use as a callback for other projects in the mean time.

Took me a while to finish working on this because I was doing this as well as other things. It's a fun project to work on and it feels like it still needs more work. It's like an indefinite work in progress and I love it.
